# Skip

[Skip](https://skip.tools) is a technology for creating dual-platform mobile apps in Swift and SwiftUI. This repository houses the `skip` tool for creating, managing, testing, and packaging Skip projects.

## Installation

See the Skip product's [Getting Started](https://skip.tools/docs/#getting-started) documentation for system requirements and installation instructions.

## Guide

Once installed, the `skip` tool is self-documenting. Use the `help` command to see a full list of other available commands:

```shell
% skip help
```

You can also get help on a particular command. For example, to see details and available options for the `skip doctor` command:

```shell
% skip help doctor
```

See the Skip product [documentation](https://skip.tools/docs) for common use cases, including how to use `skip` to [start a Skip app](https://skip.tools/docs/#start-new-app) and [start a dual-platform Skip library](http://skip.tools/docs/#start-new-library).
