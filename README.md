# Skip

[Skip](https://skip.tools) is a technology for creating dual-platform mobile apps in Swift and SwiftUI. This repository houses the `skip` tool for creating, managing, testing, and packaging Skip projects.

## Guide

See the Skip project [documentation](https://skip.tools/docs/#getting-started) for installation instructions and basic use of the `skip` tool.

Once installed, use the tool's `help` command to see a full list of other available commands:

```shell
% skip help
```

You can also get help on a particular command. For example, to see details and available options for the `skip doctor` command:

```shell
% skip help doctor
```
